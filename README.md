#  Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

**Welcome to Stroke Prediction Project !**  
The project is based on the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

## Team Members:
* Liron Cohen   
* Omer Apter

  
## What is a Stroke?
A stroke (also known as a cerebrovascular accident) occurs when there is a sudden disruption in the blood supply to brain tissue.
This disruption causes neurological damage, which may manifest in various ways such as speech difficulties, weakness or paralysis of the limbs, and trouble walking. In some cases, a stroke can lead to death.
It is the leading cause of disability among adults in the Western world and the second leading cause of death globally.
In Israel, according to the Ministry of Health, approximately 15,000 new cases of stroke occur each year.

## Database:

The database includes medical, demographic, and behavioral information on approximately 5,110 patients, and records whether each patient has had a stroke (stroke = 1) or not.
The database includes variables such as: age, sex, blood pressure, heart disease, blood glucose level, BMI, smoking status, marital status, residential area, and type of work.
In order to predict the likelihood of a stroke.

The task is to classify patients according to their risk of stroke using various machine learning algorithms, while analyzing the data, comparing the accuracy of the models, and testing additional techniques such as dimensionality reduction.

## Algorithms We Used In The Project :

* <b>SVM</b> works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong [(Source)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/spss-modeler/SaaS?topic=models-how-svm-works).
* <b>KNN</b> works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number examples (K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label (in the case of classification) or averages the labels (in the case of regression) [(Source)](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761).
* <b>Decision trees</b> use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes. The creation of sub-nodes increases the homogeneity of resultant sub-nodes. In other words, we can say that the purity of the node increases with respect to the target variable. The decision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results in most homogeneous sub-nodes [(Source)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/decision-tree-algorithm-explained.html).
* <b>Adaboost </b>
* <b>Logistic Regression </b>

## Presentation:
A presentation is also included with the project, which provides a clear and concise explanation of the objectives, methodology, data preprocessing steps, machine learning models used, results comparison, and key insights. The slides walk through the entire project flow and visually support the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Summary:

The purpose of the study is to compare different machine learning models based on their performance in the Stroke Prediction database, to identify the factors most influencing the risk of stroke, and to examine potential improvements through feature analysis, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and data pre-processing.
The results of the study will provide insights into the optimal models for classifying patients at risk for stroke, and contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between medical variables and stroke occurrence.
