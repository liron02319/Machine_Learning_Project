#  Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

**Welcome to Stroke Prediction Project !**  
The project is based on the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.
The database includes medical, demographic, and behavioral information on approximately 5,110 patients, and records whether each patient has had a stroke (stroke = 1) or not.
The database includes variables such as: age, sex, blood pressure, heart disease, blood glucose level, BMI, smoking status, marital status, residential area, and type of work.
In order to predict the likelihood of a stroke.

The task is to classify patients according to their risk of stroke using various machine learning algorithms, while analyzing the data, comparing the accuracy of the models, and testing additional techniques such as dimensionality reduction.
